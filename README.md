My implementation of Udacity mini-project [Sentiment Classification &amp; How To "Frame Problems" for a Neural Network](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/sentiment-analysis-network/Sentiment_Classification_Projects.ipynb) by Andrew Trask. It performs sentiment analysis of movie reviews by means of an artificial neural network.
